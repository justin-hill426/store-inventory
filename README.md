# store-inventory

Using knowledge of CSV and File I/O and database ORMs to build a console application that allows the user to easily interact with data for a store's inventory. The data needs to be cleaned from the CSV before it is added to the database. All interactions with the records should use ORM methods for viewing records, creating records, and exporting a new CSV backup.
